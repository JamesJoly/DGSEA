Differential Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (DGSEA) is an adaptation of the original [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) algorithm from the 
Broad Institute / MIT. It is a computational method that determines whether two <i>a priori</i> sets of genes show statistically significant differences between two biological states.

Detailed methodology can be found in our manuscript, which is at [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa658). 

DGSEA was a collaboration between the labs of [Nicholas Graham (USC)](https://grahamlab.usc.edu/) and [William Lowry (UCLA)](http://lowrylab.com/) and was executed by James Joly. This work was supported by the Viterbi School of Engineering (USC), the Mork Family Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science (USC), and the National Institute of Health (NIAMS).
